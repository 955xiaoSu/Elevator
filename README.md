# Elevator

To practice my C coding skills, I created this project that simulates the logic of an elevator.

# Usage

Clone or download this repository and run `make`. Then, start the program by typing `./elevator`.

Note: Use `Ctrl+C` to indicate that you want the elevator to pick you up and `Ctrl+Z` to exit the program. When exiting, the current floor will be saved to `./initial_floor.txt` for use next time.

**This program features:**

1. **DEBUG** mode: Make you convenient to modify parts of the code.
2. Test cases: Located in the `./testcases` directory for testing purposes.
I hope you enjoy it!
